# Stream Deck Mastodon Toot Plugin

With the great migration to Mastodon, I found it very strange that there didn't seem to already be a plugin for posting/tooting from Stream Deck. I waited patiently, but no one else got around to it - so here. Very basic implementation - I'll probably revisit this to make it more feature-full - but it seems to work at least for me and my instance. 

# Configuration Instructions

For the button to work, you will need to provide the following information: 
* API Token for your Account
  * Need at least write:statuses permissions 
* URL to your instance
* Message to Post/Toot
